*This is an extension to [Simple Colorbox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-colorbox/) plugin by [Ryan Hellyer](https://geek.hellyer.kiwi/), if you don't have it activated nothing will happen.*

When you use Simple Colorbox, it loads Colorbox files on each page. This plugin changes that and loads Colorbox files in footer of page only when there are images or gallery in post content.

Conditional Simple Colorbox is a very lightweight, it has no settings, just activate it and it works immediately.
